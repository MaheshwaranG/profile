    <p class="details">
      I have been actively learning software development since 2015. I started
      my career as a software developer in 2017. I have a deep understanding of
      software development processes, different environments, tools, protocols,
      networking, data structure, OOPs concepts, and a strong foundation in the
      basics of computer science. I am very familiar and experienced with
      application development, architecture, cloud platforms, distributed system
      design, big data, and delivering highly scalable applications. I am a
      self-motivated, self-taught who likes to solve problems, willing to learn
      new things, and works with any tech stack.
