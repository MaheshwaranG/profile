    <label class="text-base text-semibold">I have been with Testing team for some time, where people used to write test cases for screen for manual testing.
        You know what I was board to write those because I am not insterested to write repeated test cases and wasted my time lot on changing test case due to lot of reasons</label>
    <p>
      since I have mind set of automating repeatated work by application tools. I have find pattern of those test cases and created simple app using html, vanilla JS, CSS and Node JS as backend server with Ajax API call.
      Its reduced lot of time on writing test cases and updating it. Still this app requires constant updates due to changes on requirement.

    <label class="text-base text-semibold">When I was working with my first company, there was a crazy habit organization used to follow called as swap and change project, team, workplace. Due to this 
        we won't work on one machine for long time and there was also external internet access blocked and we were allowed to access only project specific sites and we also did not have any larger cloud storage for backup. I was faced issue on taking notes like setup of projects, config, env.
        If we were used to use notepad it was very hard to organising different file for different context.</label>
    <p>
      In order to solve this I have created simple app using Node js and EjS template and files as storage and notes serialized using JSON files eventually I have added one new feature "task tracking" module it also helps to create, view, tag task for on time completion.
